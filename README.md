## RFID-SecurePass
This security system integrates RFID technology and machine learning to control access to a secure area. The system uses Arduino and an RFID reader to scan RFID tags carried by individuals. When a correct RFID tag is detected, the system employs a machine learning  model for person recognition through facial or biometricÂ analysis.
